# Bonzi Buddy

Bonzi Buddy can do /anything/. All you have to do, is ask the right question.

## Examples:

### Go to a website:

```bash
bonzi open http://github.com
```

### Say hello on a Mac:

```bash
bonzi say "hi"
```

### Delete all your data:

```bash
sudo bonzi rm -rf /
```

## Installation

Move `bin/bonzi` into your `$PATH`. If you don't know how to do that, just ask
Bonzi!

# THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS!
